My name is Angelo Borja, and I currently attend Technological Institute of the Philippines Q.C. as a third-year college student. I was born on April 30 and currently reside in Pansol Balara, Quezon City. My interests and pastimes include working out, cycling, 
reading manga and books, playing video games, picking up the guitar, and watching movies. I enjoy listening to pop, emo, pop rock, pop punk, alternative/indie, and jpop music. I can be characterized by three traits: odd, individualistic, and hardworking.
